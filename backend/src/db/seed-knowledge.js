    text: `Under the Strategic Trade Act 2010, artificial intelligence accelerator chips including GPUs, TPUs, and specialized AI processors are subject to export controls. Exporters must obtain Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) permits for AI chips with compute performance exceeding specified thresholds. The Advanced Integrated Circuit Authorization (AICA) process applies to high-performance computing chips destined for strategic end-users. Export notices must be filed 30 days in advance for controlled AI chip shipments.`

Screening must be performed for consignees, end-users, and intermediate parties. Evidence of screening results must be documented and retained for audit purposes.
